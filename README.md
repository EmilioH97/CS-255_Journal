Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
For this project the client was DriverPass and they wanted to create a system that allows customers to create accounts that will give them access to
driving education and practice tests. It will also allow them to schedule appointments for drive time and also allow a secritary to schedule these appointments
for the customers.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did reaally well on my business design document because I was able to illustrate all parts of the system that was being requested by DriverPass.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would want to put more detail into my design document, specifically my activity diagram. I think I needed to include more information to create a better diagram 
that would result in less errors due to misunderstanding.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I think I did well to include all of the users needs as they requested throughout all the design documents. This is important because the system is created for the 
client therefore it must be made so they can accomplish their company goals. I recieved the customers needs through a transcript of a conversation between the 
developer and the client and this provided the information needed to complete these design documents.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach design software by listing out the needs of the client and organizing these use cases into a design that would make these functions work together to meet
the needs of the client. This technique works well for the ground work but when I design a system in the future I want to improve my ability to add more detail without
adding clutter to keep the design thorough and organized.
